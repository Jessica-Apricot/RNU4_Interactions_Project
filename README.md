Chen et al, 2024 published the paper, 'De novo variants in the RNU4-2 snRNA cause
a frequent neurodevelopmental syndrome' which found an association of variants 
within a 18bp region of the RNU4-2 spliceosomal RNA and neurodevelopmental
condition. Within the precatalytic spliceosome U4 sequesters the U6 RNA to
prevent it rearranging into the active form. While U4 is not an element in the
catalytic spliceosome we thought it pertinant to find RNA-RNA interactions which
differ between the paralouges RNU4-2 ,where the related ReNU varaint occurs in a
highly conserved 18bp regions, and RNU4-1, a highly similar sequence which 
shares the highly conserved 18bp region but does not share the same reccurant 
SNP which was associated with ReNU.
